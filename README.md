# Better Calendly
Host Calendly on your custom domain.  

### TLDR; üòé
calendly.com/your_username &#8594; book.yourdomain.com  
Works the same

### How it works? ü§ì
Better Calendly works by using the iframe embed that calendly offers but adds some CSS to make it function like the normal calendly app.

## Deploy

You will be prompted to enter two environment variables when you click one of the buttons below:
